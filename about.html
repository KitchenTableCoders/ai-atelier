            We keep it down to 5 people because that's how many fit around our
            kitchen table.

            There's no projector. We just hang out for the day, and enjoy a
            collaborative learning experience.

            <font>Chefs:</font> Hi, we're David & Amit. We both design software
            for a living and share a studio.

            people who shaped them.
        </p>
        <p>

            informal workshops at our studio with like-minded folk.
