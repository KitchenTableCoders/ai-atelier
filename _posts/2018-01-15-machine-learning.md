Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome.

Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.

<!-- AI Atelier is a new workshop series for practicing software engineers with a focus on deep learning techniques. We believe that new machine learning methods will become an essential skill for the software engineer and this series is designed to give both practical foundations and hands on engineering experience. We deeply believe that computational thinking is a fundamentally creative endeavor and the series emphasizes intuition and innovation as much a technical capability. As the workshop series name implies our classes are crafted to give you a framework for building creative solutions to challenging problems. We have years of education experience from New York University, Parsons (The New School), Stanford University, (Columbia University) as well as years of training experience through Cognitect, and Kitchen Table Coders. This training initiative is advised by engineers currently working at Google Creative Labs, Twitter, and Cognitect. -->
