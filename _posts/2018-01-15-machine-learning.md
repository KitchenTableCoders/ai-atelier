This is a hands-on introduction to applied deep learning using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), 
Google's open-source framework for machine learning. 

Participants will learn to:
- Program with the Tensorflow API
- Create & train image recognition models
- Diagnose and evaluate models 
- Tune a model
- Deploy and integrate models

The workshop is project-based, with ample time for practicing fundamentals,
asking  questions, and exploring on one's own with the support of the
instructors. Much of the time will be spent programming.

We will focus on image classifiers for our examples, but the fundamental skills
developed are portable across many applications. 

We expect participants to leave having mastered a critical subset of
the Tensorflow API: tensor manipulation, the graph, dataset IO, stacking
modelling layers, eager mode, training, and model export. Knowing how to put
these pieces together at a practical API level empowers the participant to
start solving problems and experimenting with what works.

Good results require tuning your model and applying diagnostic tools. The
workshop will build basic literacy, through examples and applications, of the
foundational ML concepts necessary for effectiveness: optimization, neural
networks, loss functions, and validation.

A big reason to choose Tensorflow over other ML frameworks is its integration 
and deployment story. We will show you how to deploy Tensorflow models in 
a service, and orient you to the broader integration options avalable in the
extended Tensorflow ecosystem. 

Lets have fun learning and building together!
