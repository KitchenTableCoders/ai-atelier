This is a hands-on introduction to [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), Google's open-source framework for machine learning. 

The workshop is project-based, leading participants through the process of building a machine learning-based image recognition application from scratch.

## Course Description

Participants will master a critical subset of the Tensorflow API: tensor manipulation, the graph, dataset IO, stacking network layers, eager mode, training, and model export. Knowing how to put those pieces together at a practical API level empowers the participant to start solving problems and experimenting with what works.

The workshop will build intuition and understanding, through examples and applications, of the foundational ML concepts necessary for effectiveness: optimization, convolutional neural networks, loss functions, and validation. You will also learn essential tips and tricks to get optimal model performance: hyper-parameter tuning, data augmentation, architecture design, and filter visualization via deconvolution. 

There will be ample time for practicing fundamentals, asking questions, and exploring beyond the presented material. We are here to help you interalize this material, make it your own, and have fun while doing it!

#### Why Tensorflow?

While there are many deep learning frameworks out there, we believe Tensorflow offers a superior combination of [performance](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance), [ease-of-use](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/10/eager-execution-imperative-define-by.html), and [tooling](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend/), making it the **framework of choice** for most use cases. Tensorflow has the best [integration and deployment](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving) story of any framework, can be used with many different [platforms](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/tensorflow) and [languages](https://js.tensorflow.org), and offers excellent utilities for [visualization](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard), [debugging](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger), and [monitoring](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend).

We will show you how to deploy Tensorflow models as a service and use the most important tools in the Tensorflow ecosystem. 

#### Course Outline

Participants will learn to:  
- Program with the Tensorflow [Python API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python)
- Create and train image recognition models
- Diagnose, evaluate, and visualize models 
- Tune a model and tweak your model architecture
- Deploy and integrate your trained models

#### Who is this program for?

This workshop is for anyone who is interested in building deep learning systems with **previous programming experience**. Whether you are a software engineer interested in using deep learning at your job, a creator using deep learning on a new project, or a manager interested in defining your team's AI strategy, you will come away with newfound skills and knowledge to apply to your domain of choice.

You should also have some experience with programming in **python** and understand **basic linear algebra**. If you need a refresher on either of these requirements before the workshop, we recommend you take a look at this [this tutorial](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/section/section1.pdf).

## Details

#### Schedule

This workshop will be offered twice, with the same content both times. Both session dates are listed below.

**Session 1:**  
Saturday, May 12, 2018 &amp; Sunday, May 13, 2018

**Session 2:**  
Saturday, June 16, 2018 &amp; Sunday, June 17, 2018

9:00 AM â€“ 5:00 PM on both days. Doors open at 8:45 AM. On Saturday evening there will be a social gathering if you would like to hang out with the instructors and other students in the space after the workshop hours.

#### Cost

**Corporate:**  
$1,250 per person

**Indie:**  
$800 per person

Cost is full admission to the two-day program. Breakfast and lunch are provided
on both days.

If you would like to attend but are unable to because of the cost, we offer a limited number of **need-based scholarships**. Send an email to [hello@kitchentablecoders.com](mailto:hello@kitchentablecoders.com) with a few sentences on your background and why you would like to attend this class. Priority will go to [underrepresented](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/digest/introduction/) groups, but we will consider everyone on a case-by-case basis.

#### Event Location

[Kitchen Table Coders](http://kitchentablecoders.com/)

274 Morgan Ave, 4th floor  
Brooklyn, NY 11238

Subway: L Grand Stop

#### What should I bring?

The primary tool we will be using is [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true), a cloud-based notebook similar to [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) which offers free access to a Tesla K80 GPU.

In order to participate in this workshop, all you will need is a **Google account** for Colaboratory and a **laptop**.
