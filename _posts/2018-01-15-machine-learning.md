This is a hands-on introduction to applied deep learning using Tensorflow.

Participants will learn core skills for training & evaluating models, and for
deploying machine-learning powered applications.

The workshop is project-based, with ample time for practicing fundamentals,
asking  questions, and exploring on one's own with the support of the
instructors. Much of the time will be spent programming. 

We will focus on CNN-based image classifiers for our examples, but lessons
will apply to other deep learning architectures and machine learning problems.

Participants will learn and practice the following:
- How to program with the Tensorflow API
- How to train their models
- How to diagnose and evaluate their models
- How to tune a model
- How to deploy Tensorflow models

We expect participants to leave having mastered a critical subset of
the Tensorflow API: tensor manipulation, the graph, dataset IO, stacking
modelling layers, eager mode, training, and model export. Knowing how to put
these pieces together at a practical API level empowers the participant to
start solving problems and experimenting with what works.

Good results require tuning your model and applying diagnostic tools. The
workshop will build basic literacy, through examples and applications, of the
foundational ML concepts necessary for effectiveness: optimization, neural
networks, loss functions, and validation.

Finally, nothing helps getting stuff done like using the right libraries. The
Tensorflow ecosystem is large and growing, with many off-the-shelf solutions
for problems like sharing model components, preprocessing data, embedding in
Big Data systems like Beam or Spark, mobile and web deployments, etc. We will
orient you to the broader ecosystem, so you know how it all fits
together and what tool to use for your specific use case.
