This is a hands-on introduction to applied deep learning using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), 
Google's open-source framework for machine learning. 

Participants will learn to:
- Program with the Tensorflow API
- Create & train image recognition models
- Diagnose and evaluate models 
- Tune a model
- Deploy and integrate models

The workshop is project-based, leading participants through completing a small but 
deployable machine learning application centered around image recognition. 

There will be ample time for practicing fundamentals, asking questions, and 
exploring beyond the presented material. We want to help you interalize this
material and make it your own. 

Participants will master a critical subset of the Tensorflow API: tensor manipulation, 
the graph, dataset IO, stacking modelling layers, eager mode, training, and model export. 

Knowing how to put those pieces together at a practical API level empowers the 
participant to start solving problems and experimenting with what works.

Good results require tuning your model and applying diagnostic tools. The
workshop will build basic literacy, through examples and applications, of the
foundational ML concepts necessary for effectiveness: optimization, neural
networks, loss functions, and validation.

A big reason to choose Tensorflow over other ML frameworks is its integration 
and deployment story. We will show you how to deploy Tensorflow models in 
a service, and orient you to the broader integration options avalable in the
extended Tensorflow ecosystem. 

Lets have fun learning and building together!
