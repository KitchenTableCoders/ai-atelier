About Kitchen Table Coders: 
Hi, we're David Nolen & Amit Pitaru & Ted Hayes. We both design software for a living and also share a studio in Brooklyn. We're ever curious about new and old languages, as well as the people who shaped them. Sometimes we teach graduate courses at NYU ITP, so we figured why not do informal workshops at our studio with like-minded folk.
 
Every week we host a workshop on a topic we're passionate about. We keep it down to 6 people because that's how many fit around our kitchen table. There's no projector. We just hang out for the day, and enjoy a collaborative learning experience.
