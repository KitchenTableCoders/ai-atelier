Contemporary web applications have raised the bar for interactive user experiences in browsers of all shapes and sizes, and programming for this fluid medium is a unique challenge.

Modern UI development requires a thorough understanding of JavaScript, the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern, and asynchronous programming.

We'll walk you through the many winding paths of creating robust web UIs with an emphasis on the underlying concepts. You should have intermediate programming experience with any language (but some experience with JavaScript is a must).
