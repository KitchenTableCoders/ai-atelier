This is a hands-on introduction to [deep
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) using
[Tensorflow.js](http://js.tensorflow.org), Google's open-source JavaScript
framework for machine learning.

The workshop is project-based, leading participants through the process of
building a machine learning-based image recognition application from scratch.

## Course Description

Participants will master a critical subset of the Tensorflowj.s API: tensor
manipulation, the graph, stacking network layers, training, and model export.
Knowing how to put those pieces together at a practical API level empowers the
participant to start solving problems and experimenting with what works.

The workshop will build intuition and understanding, through examples and
applications, of the foundational ML concepts necessary for effectiveness:
optimization, convolutional neural networks, loss functions, and validation. You
will also learn essential tips and tricks to get optimal model performance:
hyper-parameter tuning, data augmentation, architecture design, and filter
visualization.

There will be ample time for practicing fundamentals, asking questions, and
exploring beyond the presented material. We are here to help you interalize this
material, make it your own, and have fun while doing it!

#### Why Tensorflow?

While there are many deep learning frameworks out there, Tensorflow's
combination of [performance](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance),
[ease-of-use](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/10/eager-execution-imperative-define-by.html),
and a [rich developer ecosystem](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) makes
it an excellent choice for wide range of research and production use cases.
Tensorflow has the best [integrated deployment
story](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving) of any framework, can be used with
many different
[platforms](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/tensorflow)
and [languages](https://js.tensorflow.org), and offers best-in-class utilities
for
[visualization](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard),
[debugging](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger), and
[monitoring](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend).

#### Course Outline

Participants will learn to:  
- Program with the Tensorflow.js [API](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/0.11.6/)
- Create and train image recognition models
- Diagnose, evaluate, and visualize models 
- Tune a model and tweak your model architecture
- Integrate your trained models

#### Who is this program for?

This workshop is for anyone who is interested in building deep learning systems
with **previous programming experience**. Whether you are a software engineer
interested in using deep learning at your job, a creator using deep learning on
a new project, or an engineering manager interested in defining your team's AI
strategy, you will come away with newfound skills and knowledge to apply to your
domain of choice.

You should also have some experience with programming in **JavaScript** and
understand **basic linear algebra**. If you need a refresher on either of these
requirements before the workshop, we recommend you take a look at this [this
tutorial](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/section/section1.pdf).
