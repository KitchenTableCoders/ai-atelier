Node.js is a young yet promising project for writing server-side JavaScript. In this workshop we’ll build a basic Node.js server on our laptops and use WebSockets to build a simple realtime multiuser graphical environment.

As Node.js lends itself particularly well to a functional style of programming, we’ll take the opportunity to introduce basic functional programming. Finally, we’ll discuss some of the unique advantages of the NodeJS event-based model as well as its current limitations.

This workshop assumes you have basic familiarity with at least one programming language.

In order to allow us more time to code, we kindly ask that you have Node.js installed on your laptop (you’ll need to be running a local server). On OSX, you can download this install package and just double-click to install:<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/nodejsmacosx/">https://sites.google.com/site/nodejsmacosx/</a>
