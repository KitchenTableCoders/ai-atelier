In order to understand iOS development it's critical to have a good foundation. A good foundation means examining the design philosophy behind the programming language at the heart of Apple's technologies - Objective-C. In this workshop we'll study two of the most influential programming languages of all time C and Smalltalk - the unlikely pairing that produced Objective-C. We'll then talk about how to design programs in Objective-C. Expect to learn a good deal about the essence of C programming as well the beauty of messaging based Object Oriented Programming.

*Perquisites:* Familiarity with at least one programming language, XCode.
