This is a hands-on introduction to [deep
learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) using
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), Google's open-source framework for
machine learning.

The workshop is project-based, leading participants through the process of
building a machine learning-based image recognition application from scratch.

## Course Description

Participants will master a critical subset of the Tensorflow API: tensor
manipulation, the graph, dataset IO, stacking network layers, eager mode,
training, and model export. Knowing how to put those pieces together at a
practical API level empowers the participant to start solving problems and
experimenting with what works.

The workshop will build intuition and understanding, through examples and
applications, of the foundational ML concepts necessary for effectiveness:
optimization, convolutional neural networks, loss functions, and validation. You
will also learn essential tips and tricks to get optimal model performance:
hyper-parameter tuning, data augmentation, architecture design, and filter
visualization.

There will be ample time for practicing fundamentals, asking questions, and
exploring beyond the presented material. We are here to help you interalize this
material, make it your own, and have fun while doing it!

#### Why Tensorflow?

While there are many deep learning frameworks out there, Tensorflow's
combination of [performance](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance),
[ease-of-use](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/10/eager-execution-imperative-define-by.html),
and a [rich developer ecosystem](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) makes
it an excellent choice for wide range of research and production use cases.
Tensorflow has the best [integrated deployment
story](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving) of any framework, can be used with
many different
[platforms](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gpu-accelerated-applications/tensorflow)
and [languages](https://js.tensorflow.org), and offers best-in-class utilities
for
[visualization](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard),
[debugging](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/debugger), and
[monitoring](https://www.tensorflow.org/extend).

We will show you how to deploy Tensorflow models as a service and use the most
important tools in the Tensorflow ecosystem. 

#### Course Outline

Participants will learn to:  
- Program with the Tensorflow [Python API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python)
- Create and train image recognition models
- Diagnose, evaluate, and visualize models 
- Tune a model and tweak your model architecture
- Deploy and integrate your trained models

#### Who is this program for?

This workshop is for anyone who is interested in building deep learning systems
with **previous programming experience**. Whether you are a software engineer
interested in using deep learning at your job, a creator using deep learning on
a new project, or an engineering manager interested in defining your team's AI
strategy, you will come away with newfound skills and knowledge to apply to your
domain of choice.

You should also have some experience with programming in **python** and
understand **basic linear algebra**. If you need a refresher on either of these
requirements before the workshop, we recommend you take a look at this [this
tutorial](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs231a/section/section1.pdf).

## Details

#### Schedule

This workshop will be offered twice, with the same content both times. Both
session dates are listed below.

**Session 1:**  
Saturday, May 12, 2018 &amp; Sunday, May 13, 2018

**Session 2:**  
Saturday, June 16, 2018 &amp; Sunday, June 17, 2018

9:00 AM â€“ 5:00 PM on both days. Doors open at 8:45 AM. On Saturday evening there
will be a social gathering if you would like to hang out with the instructors
and other students in the space after the workshop hours.

#### Cost

**Corporate:**  
$1,250 per person

**Indie:**  
$800 per person

Cost is full admission to the two-day program. Breakfast and lunch are provided
on both days.

If you would like to attend but are unable to because of the cost, we offer a
limited number of **need-based scholarships**. Send an email to
[hello@kitchentablecoders.com](mailto:hello@kitchentablecoders.com) with a few
sentences on your background and why you would like to attend this class.
Priority will go to
[underrepresented](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2017/nsf17310/digest/introduction/)
groups, but we will consider everyone on a case-by-case basis.

If you or your company is interested in sponsoring the event please get in touch
[hello@kitchentablecoders.com](mailto:hello@kitchentablecoders.com).

#### Event Location

[Kitchen Table Coders](http://kitchentablecoders.com/)

274 Morgan Ave, 4th floor  
Brooklyn, NY 11238

Subway: L Grand Stop

#### What should I bring?

The primary tool we will be using is
[Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true),
a cloud-based notebook similar to [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) which offers
free access to a Tesla K80 GPU.

In order to participate in this workshop, all you will need is a **Google
account** for Colaboratory and a **laptop** with
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) installed.
