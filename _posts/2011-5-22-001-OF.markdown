We’ll spend Sunday afternoon building our own drawing software with OpenFrameworks. 
 
The first part of the day will be dedicated to a bit of C++ foundation. We’ll touch on the basic and relevant aspects of C++ that can serve us well for creative prototyping.
 
Next, we’ll start coding a simple drawing program and get familiar OF’s drawing API and Mouse/Key events. We’ll slowly expand our programs to include more of what OF has to offer.
