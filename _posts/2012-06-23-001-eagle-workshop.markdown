With Tedb0t
 
Breadboards are all fun and games until you need 100 pieces of your design!  This workshop will show you, from start to finish, how to record your electronic project design into a schematic in EAGLE (free software for Mac & PC), lay out a circuit board design, and get it manufactured.  Once you learn how, you'll never hand-solder your projects again!

Some electronics experience recommended, but this class is totally suitable for beginners as well as intermediates.  Just bring your laptop and, if you want, a project you'd like to learn how to turn into your very own Printed Circuit Board (PCB).  Download and install the <a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/?language=en">necessary software here/</a> before you come.
