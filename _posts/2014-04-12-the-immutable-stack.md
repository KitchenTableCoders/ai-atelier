Kitchen Table Coders are excited to announce "The Immutable Stack", a full day of training on Clojure, Datomic, ClojureScript, and Om. We believe the immutable stack is a game changer for architecting robust, modern applications.

The goal of the class is to give students hands-on experience building a real end-to-end immutable app, and to have them leave prepared to exercise those skills in the wild. With this training, we aim to replicate the same small hands-on experience that is a signature of our workshops while at the same time going much, much further in depth. 

Only a basic understanding of Clojure is required.

The following is a rough outline of the material we expect to cover:

* Backend
  * The Database: Datomic
    * Schemas
    * Datomic Datalog
    * Transactions
    * Deployment
  * The API: Ring / Jetty
    * Middleware
    * Live development
    * Deployment
* Frontend
  * Developing ClojureScript Apps
    * ClojureScript
    * Google Closure
    * lein-cljsbuild configuration
    * Source maps & debugging
  * Applicaion State: UI as EDN
    * Introduction to Om
    * Reusable components
    * Undo / Redo and Time Travel
    * Client / Server synchronization
