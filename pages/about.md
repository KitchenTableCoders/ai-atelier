 AI Atelier is a new workshop series for practicing software engineers with a focus on deep learning techniques. We believe that new machine learning methods will become an essential skill for the software engineer and this series is designed to give both practical foundations and hands on engineering experience. We deeply believe that computational thinking is a fundamentally creative endeavor and the series emphasizes intuition and innovation as much a technical capability. As the workshop series name implies our classes are crafted to give you a framework for building creative solutions to challenging problems. We have years of education experience from New York University, Parsons (The New School), Stanford University, (Columbia University) as well as years of training experience through Cognitect, and Kitchen Table Coders. This training initiative is advised by engineers currently working at Google Creative Labs, Twitter, and Cognitect.

 <h3>Kovas Boguta</h3>
 <h4>Instructor</h4>

 <p>
 Kovas Boguta has spent 15 years in scientific computing, data infrastructure,
and machine learning roles. At Wolfram Research he helped build Mathematica and
Wolfram Alpha, and served as instructor at the Wolfram Science summer school. At
Weebly, Kovas built out the Hadoop-based analytics infrastructure. At Twitter,
Kovas helped develop the internal deep learning platform, and is now applying ML
to recommendations problems. His favorite cellular automaton is Rule 110.

    <p>
    Evan Casey is an engineer and researcher. He currently works on deep
reinforcement learning for robotics at Cogitai. Previously he worked in the
ad-tech industry building large-scale data infrastructure, has done research on
recommendation systems, and is an alumnus of the Recurse Center. His research
interests are in reinforcement learning, deep learning, and autonomous systems.
He blogs at <a href="http://ev.ancasey.com/">ev.ancasey</a> and is active on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ev_ancasey">@ev_ancasey</a>.

   <p>
    Amit is a coder and designer. He is currently at Google Creative Lab exploring
    the intersection of AI techniques and creative expression. Formerly a
    professional musician, his work to date spans across experimental art, research,
    education, and entrepreneurial projects. A recurring theme in Amit’s work is the
    extreme attention to user-experience, specifically how technology can promote
    (or destroy) curiosity, literacy, and creativity.
   </p>
  <p>
    As an educator, Amit develops curricula that focus on the coupling of technology
    and the creative thought process. He taught at New York University’s ITP and
    Cooper Union’s Arts department. Amit is also the co-founder of Kitchen Table Coders.

  <p>
    David Nolen is a software engineer with a background in programming languages,
    compilers, databases, and expert systems. He has taught at New York University,
    been a resident at of the Recurse Center and worked for Princeton University,
    The Modern Museum of Art, and The New York Times. He is an international speaker
    on the usage of functional programming techniques to simplify software
    development practice. He is currently employed at Cognitect building systems for
    clients around the world. With Amit Pitaru he founded the Kitchen Table Coders
    workshop series in Brooklyn. He likes to play Go.
