   <p>
   AI Atelier is a workshop series in New York City focused on enabling people of all backgrounds to understand and build deep learning systems.
    </p>
   <p>
   Deep learning is dramatically improving <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2018/04/an-augmented-reality-microscope.html">medicine</a>, <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/ai/nsynth-super">art</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40464024/how-john-deeres-new-ai-lab-is-designing-farm-equipment-for-more-sustainable-future">agriculture</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/237834525">finance</a> and many other fields. We believe these methods will become an essential skill for the software engineer and creator as we further unlock its vast potential.
    </p>
    <p>
    At AI Atelier you will develop both practical foundations and hands on engineering experience. While you need to know how to program to attend AI Atelier, we’ve had students attend with as little as six months of programming experience and as much as 30 years of professional programming experience.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our classes are crafted to give you a framework for applying deep learning to real world problems. While there are many online resources that focus solely on the theoretical underpinnings of AI, there are few that provide practical guidance on how to design, tune, debug, and build deep learning systems from the ground up.
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe computational thinking is a fundamentally creative endeavor and the series emphasizes intuition and innovation as much a technical capability. Every workshop is project-based, and you will come away with a fully-functioning machine learning project.

    <h4>Amit Pitaru</h4>
    <img width="200" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/bios/amit_pitaru.jpg" />
    <p>
    Amit is a coder and designer. He is currently at Google Creative Lab exploring
the intersection of AI techniques and creative expression. Formerly a
professional musician, his work to date spans across experimental art, research,
education, and entrepreneurial projects. A recurring theme in Amit’s work is the
extreme attention to user-experience, specifically how technology can promote
(or destroy) curiosity, literacy, and creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
    As an educator, Amit develops curricula that focus on the coupling of technology
and the creative thought process. He taught at New York University’s ITP and
Cooper Union’s Arts department. Amit is also the co-founder of Kitchen Table Coders.
