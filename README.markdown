## Introduction

This repo holds the code for Kitchen Table Coder's **AI Atelier** website. The site is written in Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages.

To view the site locally, first install the Ruby development tools and Jekyll. Run `bundle exec jekyll server` and navigate to [localhost:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000) to view the site.

## CSS

The site reads from `assets/css/main.scss`. Jekyll will take a look at the file name and render css from the Sass source.
